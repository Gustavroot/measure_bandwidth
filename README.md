# measure_bandwidth

Code allowing an approximate measurement of RAM bandwidth, within the context of vectorization (SSE, AVX2 or AVX-512). To check bandwidth for a particular vectorization scheme go to sse/ or avx2/ or avx512/, and execute 'sh run.sh'. Furthermore, go inside the script run.sh to switch between double/float as desired.
